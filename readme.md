# OSC Router

Simple UDP/TCP OSC packet router library, based on https://www.npmjs.com/package/osc

The idea for this library was taken from https://github.com/ETCLabs/OSCRouter. This is a base for other libraries (Electron/CLI) to be able to generate OSC "Routes" similar to ETC's OSC Router

## Getting Started

To get started with this base project it's as easy as running

```npm install```

You won't be able to do much with it though so you might want to look at oscrouter-cli

### Prerequisites

Once you've ran npm install you'll probably want to be able to link this to another module or use it inside of your project.

```
const {Routes} = require('oscrouter');
```

### Building

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
